CISP 1010 Final Project Log - Entry 1

	We've had a few meetings already, but I haven't written anything in here about them. Still, better late than never!
	I'm planning to work on a breakdown for the project that we can work with today. I want to try to write out what a user would see using the program to get an idea what is going to be needed for it to work. If I have time, I'll try and make a more detailed pseudocode document. Either way, I plan to share what I have with the group at our meeting later.

Entry 2
I got part of the breakdown done, but it's going slower than expected. Maybe I should find a faster way to do this...

Entry 3
Got Sale class and tester done, I think we're making good progress!

Entry 4
Been working on the main class and trying to make sense of GitHub. I think the former is going better.
